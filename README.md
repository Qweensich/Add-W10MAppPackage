# Add-W10MAppPackage
PowerShell script partially based on the autogenerated Add-AppDevPackage.ps1 to facilitate Windows 10 Mobile application package deployment to devices. Made by Rodrigo 'r2d2rigo' Diaz.

### How to use

Copy to a folder containing a .appx ARM package and run, it will automatically deploy the application package to a Windows 10 Mobile device connected to the computer running the script. Some of the default options can be overriden by specifying the following parameters:

- -Force (boolean): skips any user input for finishing execution.
- -WindowsSdkPath (string): path to the WinAppDeployCmd.exe tool in case it's not installed in the default location.
- -DeviceIp (string): IP address of the mobile device the application will be deployed to.
